Ideas for the game:
#possibly change the name to something more adventure-like
#player may choose from different roles (mage, archer, knight, etc.)
#items found throughout the game
#player has an inventory
#player can manage their inventory (add, drop, use items)

#player can die ---- player has HP
#player can kill foes ---- player deals damage
#player can select a name for themselves
#player should be able to save their progress and return to where they stopped
#this can be done after the game is finished -- finish the game before coding a save/load function


##########################
Levels will be made in functions
Starting with Level 1
Levels will be imported and ran in the main file


##############################
ENEMIES
each enemy (specifically bosses) will be created in the level functions

there should be an enemy class that all enemies can inherit from

a few different types of enemies (each level different theme?)

enemies have two different options attack and special ability(unique for each enemy type)

each enemy has a goofy ass name from a random name generator 

enemy has a chance to drop an item, and this chance is lower as level increases

#############################
PLAYER 

player has 4 stats HP, DEFENSE, ATTACK, LUCK

player has a level that goes up with XP from killing enemies

upon level up gets to assign a skillpoint that increases stat by x%

players inventory has the option to be viewed after killing an enemy or pressing a specific key?

players may obtain consumables that can be used in battle

player has the option to use consumable or attack while in combat

player HP resets after each level but not after killing an enemy 

############################### 
LEVEL ANATOMY 

each level will consist of X amount of enemies that increases with each level (adds difficulty)

each level has a minimum of one rest stop where u can increase attack stat or regenerate x% of missing HP 

each level is capped off with a unique boss that has a delayed special move (can only be used after x amount of turns?)

each boss drops 3 artifacts and u have to pick one these artifacts all have a unique bonus 

each level has a unique theme with a specific type of enemy consistent throughout all fights

there is at least 1 fight in each level where the player has to fight multiple enemies

there should also be a story to each level, but all the stories for each level should tie together somehow
