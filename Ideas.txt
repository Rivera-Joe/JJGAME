Ideas for the game:
#possibly change the name to something more adventure-like
#player may choose from different roles (mage, archer, knight, etc.)
#items found throughout the game
#player has an inventory
#player can manage their inventory (add, drop, use items)

#player can die ---- player has HP
#player can kill foes ---- player deals damage
#player can select a name for themselves
